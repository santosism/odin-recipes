    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This is a hot dog, made of some assorted materials, meatlike I'm sure. But it goes well at barbecues, at ball games,
         movie theaters, on a cheap night at home, or just bored and a little hungry: hot dogs cooked in cooking wine. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Hot Dog Buns</li>

      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
