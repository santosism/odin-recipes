# odin-recipes
This is the first HTML project, from The Odin Project. I decided to be a little humorous and to have some fun. Also first time with using git commands and Github. And since I don't really cook beyond microwaveable meals and vegan Gardein
packets, I figured might as well have some fun with this.
